# GCN
Graph Convolution Network

To my understanding there are some data structures whose shapes can not be summarized in euclidean distances.

For such structures the use of Graphs to analyze all this information is better hence the need of GCNs.

This is a simple reimplementation of some of the code I have bumped into on GitHub.

I have kept it so close here such that I can come back to it later.

Feel free to play around with it so you can learn too...

## Improvements

I want to see how I can apply some other sort of data using this method, once I get a dataset that can satisfy the kind of analysis I would like to do.
